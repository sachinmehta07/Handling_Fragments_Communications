#Fragment Loading and Backpress Android App

The app we developed allows users to navigate between two fragments, Fragment 1 and Fragment 2, and control their display through the use of buttons. Here's a description of the key features and functionality of the app:

Main Activity: The app launches with a main activity screen that contains a FrameLayout and two buttons at the bottom. The FrameLayout serves as the container for displaying the fragments, while the buttons allow users to load Fragment 1 or Fragment 2.

Fragment 1: Fragment 1 is the initial fragment displayed when the app launches. It contains a custom layout that can be designed and customized as per the specific requirements. Pressing the "Fragment 1" button highlights it and loads Fragment 1 in the FrameLayout.

Fragment 2: Fragment 2 can be loaded by pressing the "Fragment 2" button. Similar to Fragment 1, it has its custom layout that can be tailored to meet the desired design and functionality. Pressing the "Fragment 2" button highlights it and loads Fragment 2 in the FrameLayout.

Back Press Handling: The app handles the back press event to ensure smooth navigation between fragments. If Fragment 2 is currently displayed, pressing the back button will navigate back to Fragment 1 and highlight the "Fragment 1" button. However, if Fragment 1 is displayed, pressing the back button will close the application.

The app effectively demonstrates the use of fragments in Android development, allowing users to switch between different screens and providing a seamless back press navigation experience. With this app, users can experience the power and flexibility of fragments in building dynamic and interactive Android applications.
